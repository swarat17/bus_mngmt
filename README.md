# DIGIYAAN - Bus Tracking System 🚍

DIGIYAAN is a first-of-its-kind in-house digital solution implemented at Tata Steel, designed to provide real-time tracking and information for buses operating within the Tata Steel Jamshedpur plant premises. The system is built to enhance accessibility, optimize resources, and improve overall commuting efficiency for employees and contract workers.

---

## 🚀 Introduction
- **Problem Statement**:  
  There are 24 buses connecting 30 bus stops across various routes inside Tata Steel, Jamshedpur. Due to the unavailability of a real-time tracking system, employees and contract workers face inconveniences while commuting within the plant premises.  
- **Motivation**:  
  With restrictions on two-wheeler commutes, the demand for internal buses has increased. DIGIYAAN aims to resolve these challenges by providing real-time tracking and route information for buses.

## 💡 Our Idea
The project introduces an **in-house web application** with real-time tracking features for buses operating within Tata Steel Jamshedpur. This innovative solution will:
- Fetch users' live location and guide them to the nearest bus stop.
- Provide estimated time of arrival (ETA) for buses.
- Display bus routes, schedules, and bus numbers, enhancing commuter convenience.

---

## 🔧 Features of the Proposed System
1. **Real-time Tracking**:  
   Users can monitor the movement of buses and get details such as ETA and current location.
2. **Route Assistance**:  
   The app calculates the nearest bus stop and guides users to reach it.
3. **Comprehensive Information**:  
   Details of available buses, routes, and schedules across the plant premises are provided.
4. **User-friendly Interface**:  
   Simple navigation to select source and destination with all relevant information at their fingertips.

---

## 🌟 Benefits
- **Fleet Optimization**: Effective management, tracking, and resource utilization.
- **Accessibility**: Improved commute experience for employees and new visitors.
- **Sustainability**: Encourages the use of public transport, reducing the carbon footprint.
- **Productivity**: Saves time and effort, leading to enhanced work efficiency.

## 🛠️ Process Workflow
1. User logs into the system using their credentials.
2. System fetches the user's current location using GPS.
3. App identifies the nearest bus stop and routes the user to it.
4. Real-time bus tracking shows:
   - Available buses.
   - Routes and bus numbers.
   - Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA).
5. Displays comprehensive details about all buses across different routes.
